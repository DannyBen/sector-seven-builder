## Overview

Turn the numeric keypad of your keyboard to a Windows command execution 
system.

Once ControlPad is running, press and hold the <kbd>*</kbd> key on the 
numeric keypad, for about 1 second. 

At this point, a small window will pop up, allowing you to enter any 
keyword or numeric code.

Pressing the code followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> will execute the 
associated command.

Commands are easily configured through the same interface - activate the 
input dialog (press and hold <kbd>*</kbd>), enter the desired code and 
press the numpad Divide (<kbd>/</kbd>) button to associate a new command.

You may also use words instead of numeric codes.

For laptop users (without a numeric keypad), there is a special 
**Laptop Mode** feature which will use <kbd>F12</kbd> (press and hold) 
instead of <kbd>*</kbd> as the launch key.
