## Overview

MorseRabbit is a small utility designed to help you learn to tap and 
understand Morse Code.

MorseRabbit has two training modes, each with 5 levels of difficulty:

* Normal Mode: You are provided with a morse code sequence (both the visual and audible representation) and are expected to type in the correct word in time.
* Reverse Mode: You are provided with an alphabetic sequence or a word, and are expected to tap the corresponding morse code.

After you master the 5 training levels, you can continue your morse education with these lessons:

* Lesson 6 - Words  
This lesson uses dictionary words instead of random letters.
* Lessons 7 and above  
In these lessons you practice aspects of morse code that are beyond just knowing the alphabet. You can practice Prosigns (like the well known SOS), abbreviations and Q-Codes.


## Installation

MorseRabbit requires no installation.

If you have downloaded the compiled version, extract the ZIP archive to a new folder and run the MorseRabbit executable.

To uninstall, delete all files.

## Usage

If you want to **Tap a morse sequence to see what word it generates**:

* Stop the training if it is running.
* Start tapping the Spacebar.
* You may adjust the speed slider, to tell MorseRabbit how to listen to your taps.

If you want to **Practice in understanding morse code**:

* Make sure the Reverse Training checkbox is clear.
* Select a difficulty level.
* Press the Start button.
* Now, type the letters representing the morse code you hear.

If you want to **Practice morse code tapping**:

* Make sure the Reverse Training checkbox is checked.
* Select a difficulty level.
* Press the Start button.
* Now, use the spacebar to tap the morse code for the letter. Short press for a DIT, long press for a DAH.
* Pressing backspace, left arrow or delete, will mark the word as failed.
